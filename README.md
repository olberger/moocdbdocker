TODO describe what this is (hint : port to docker of https://fusionforge.int-evry.fr/projects/moocbdvm/ which uses Vagrant)

Using
=====

Build docker images (can be long):
```sh
docker build -t tsp-moocdb-postgres tsp-moocdb-postgres/
docker build -t tsp-moocdb-web tsp-moocdb-web/
```

Launch (order is important):
```sh
docker run -d --name tsp-moocdb-postgres tsp-moocdb-postgres
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name web --link tsp-moocdb-postgres:tsp-moocdb-postgres tsp-moocdb-web
```

Use:
* Visit http://localhost:8080/
* Login to phpPgAdmin with:
  *  ```pg_reader/tpinfint``` for read access
  *  ```pg_writer/tpinfint``` for read/write access

How does it works and how can I update the content
==================================================

All the database stuff is in ```tsp-moocdb-postgres```. This container is based on
[the official postgresql image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) which provides a simple way to
execute initialization scripts: place a ```.sh``` shell script in ```/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d```
and it will be executed at creation.

It is exactly how we do it! We just drop the file 
[```initdb-setupdb.sh```](https://github.com/pfe-asr-2014/moocdbdocker/blob/master/tsp-moocdb-postgres/initdb-setupdb.sh)
which executes several sql commands and that's all!

So if you want to change the generated schema, all you have to do is to change this  ```initdb-setupdb.sh``` (or add another one, if you want to
separate your logic in several files).

The other container (```tsp-moocdb-web```) runs the bdsqlwiz PHP application (directory ```./appli```), PhpPgAdmin and an index for our users.
You can update the application easily: just change the content of the directory and you're ready to ship your new content!
